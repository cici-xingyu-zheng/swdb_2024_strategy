## Information

We document in this repo the progress of modeling and inferring lick behavior in the Allen Visual Behavior Neuropixel Dataset.

### Data
load from a local hard drive; but can be alternatively obtained from the cloud server (Amzn S3 bucket);

### Useful resourses

#### `allensdk` usages of this dataset:

####  Alex Piet's work:
1.  [Licking Behavior Ecephys](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/licking_behavior_NP)
2.  [Licking Behavior Ophys](https://github.com/alexpiet/licking_behavior/tree/master)

Note that both use some internal/local load paths that are a bit hard to parse what they really are.

####  `psytrack` package:
- [repo](https://github.com/nicholas-roy/psytrack/blob/master/psytrack/examples/ExampleNotebook.ipynb)
- We have installed it; the example ran very smoothly in `/psytrack_example` folder

#### Logistics:

| Saturday 9:00 â€“ 12:00 |	Project presentations |
